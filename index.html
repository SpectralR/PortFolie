		<!-- présentation -->
		<p>Pours fizzy, creating a beige/eggshell-colored foamy head that's dense image and wonderfully laced, sticking to the glass and also retaining magnificently. In fact, the lacing stays until the end. Beneath, a deep brown brew with rich tawny hues. This beer has some serious legs. Complex aromas: soft and powdery on the nose, with aromas of malt, chocolate chip cookie dough and a deep-rooted fruitiness, notes of plum skins, spicy phenols and a soft bready yeast character.</p>
		<!-- experiences -->
		<p>The 11.2-ounce stubby bottle pours a muddy copper with a creamy and frothy beige head and sticky retention. Decanted carefully to keep the dregs (which are plentiful) from pouring out of the bottle. Yeasty, lightly vegetal, metallic, with a subtle spiciness and sweet alcohol in the nose. Light on the palate, with a prickly carbonation and creaminess in its wake. Delicious dark fruitiness of cherries, raisins and ripe plums. Very malty, with undertones of sweet chocolate, mild coffee and caramelized sugars. Crisp, dry edge. Spicy alcohol, a splash of coriander, and a slight tartness that helps tease and tame the sweetness. Soft, drying, powdery feel in the finish. Incredibly more-ish, as in, why, yes we'd love to have another. And with a very deceptive 11 percent alcohol by volume, we will.</p>
