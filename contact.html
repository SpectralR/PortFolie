			<p class="p-base flex-base flex-center">Brewed with licorice; a proprietary, hand-smoked malt; and almost a pound of East Kent Goldings hops per barrel. Opaque brown in color, with muddy brown edges and a cola-colored head that drops quickly to a ringed lace. Strong and dominating licorice aroma with an underlying robust molasses-ness and highly roasted malts. Thick-ish, deep blackstrap molasses character (sweet, tangy nectar), quite robust. Licorice is assertive and smacks of herbal flavors. As the beer warms, both flavors become very intense, overpowering the palate a bit with some cloying action. Hop presence is masked; however, there is some and it peaks with a tannin feel and semi-citric sharpness. Rough and long-lingering finish with molasses, and soft anise residuals sticking to the palate. A tough one to drink. The use of molasses and licorice is simply overwhelming and without balance.</p>

			<p class="p-base flex-base flex-center">Out of the bottle and into the glass, the beer pours a very rich, vibrant, copper-colored brew with a seemingly thick consistency, evidenced by the sluggish carbonation bubbles rising to the top. Topped with a very healthy, thick, slightly off-white foam head, the beers lacing is tight and creamy, sticking to the glass and retaining very well. Complex piney and resin-y hop nose with gentle floral notes and a bit of a peppery and spicy rye edge tucked within. Aroma suggests something sweet, with malty caramel up front, loads of enticing ripe fruits, then alcohol.</p>

			<p class="p-base flex-base flex-center">A beer you could drink all day and all night. Dark amber in color. A delectably complex malt profile reminiscent of bread, toast, and biscuits, with hints of caramel, chocolate, and fruity esters. Perfectly balanced bitterness from the earthy, floral hops. Take one sip and another is sure to immediately follow… and another… and another…</p>
